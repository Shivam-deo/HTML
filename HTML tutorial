HTML Tutorial: Installing VS Code & Live Server | Web Development Tutorials

In this tutorial, we are going to start our first HTML tutorial. In the last tutorial,
we have learnt about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how the web server reverts with the 
response after getting the request. We will now learn about how to write HTML code in the 
Visual Studio Code.
It is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which makes our work a lot easier. Therefore, 
I recommend everyone to download this software and install it. Make a folder named
“Complete Web development Bootcamp” and then open VS Code in that folder by pressing right-click >
Open with code. In case, you can’t find the option of opening the particular folder with Visual Studio, 
you can restart your PC or laptop to make sure that changes have taken place after you installed VS Code.
